# EREG
Endless Random Encounter Generator

This is an endless turn based roguelike game where the player must make clever use of enemy weaknesses and special statuses to progress as far as possible. Hitting an enemy weakness or scoring a critical hit grants you a bonus turn allowing you to chain together knock-downs. The player must also carefully manage their resources to give them the best chance to make it further than their best.
